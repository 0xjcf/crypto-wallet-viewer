# Cryptocurrency Wallet Viewer Tutorial

Welcome to our tutorial, where we're building an application that lets users log in and view their Bitcoin and Ethereum wallet balances. This beginner-friendly guide will walk you through setting up a basic Express server with TypeScript and gradually adding more features.

## Navigating the Lessons

Each lesson in this tutorial is contained within its own branch, structured to guide you through the development process step by step. To follow along, please switch to the relevant lesson branch:

- `lesson-1`: Basic Express Server Setup with TypeScript - Set up a simple Express server using TypeScript, introducing the project structure and basic routing.
- `lesson-2`: Integrating MongoDB with Mongoose - Connect your application to MongoDB using Mongoose for user management and data persistence.
- `lesson-3`: Setting Up Passport.js for User Authentication - Implement user authentication using Passport.js, allowing users to register, log in, and log out.
- `lesson-4`: Integrating Bitcoin Wallet Functionality - Add functionality to allow users to view their Bitcoin wallet balance by integrating with a Bitcoin API.
- `lesson-5`: Integrating Ethereum Wallet Functionality - Extend the application to support Ethereum, enabling users to check their Ethereum wallet balance using the Ethereum blockchain.
- `lesson-6a`: Refactoring to MVC and Testing Setup - This lesson covers moving to an MVC architecture, setting up testing with Jest, including unit tests for our routes (now controllers), and integrating continuous testing tools like Wallaby.js (optional).
- `lesson-6b`: Implementing Mocks and Writing Tests - Dive deeper into testing by creating mocks for external dependencies like Passport, Axios, and Web3, and writing comprehensive tests for controllers, configurations, and utility functions.

Further lessons will be added in subsequent branches.

Please check out each branch for detailed instructions and implementations specific to that part of the tutorial.
