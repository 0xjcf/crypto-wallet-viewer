## Lesson 3: Setting Up Passport.js for User Authentication

### Objective

To implement user authentication in our application using Passport.js, enabling secure login, registration, and logout functionalities.

### High-Level Steps

1. **Install Passport and Related Packages**: Add Passport, passport-local for local strategy, and bcrypt for password hashing. `npm install passport passport-local bcrypt
npm install --save-dev @types/passport @types/passport-local @types/bcrypt`

2. **Configure Passport Local Strategy**: Create a `passportConfig.ts` file and define the local strategy for user authentication.

3. **Setup Authentication Routes**: Define routes for user registration, login, and logout in `authRoutes.ts`.

4. **Integrate Passport into Express Application**: Initialize Passport and configure session handling in `server.ts`.

5. **Testing**: Verify that users can register, log in, and log out successfully.

### Conclusion

Integrating Passport.js provides a robust and flexible system for managing user authentication. By leveraging the local strategy, we ensure that users can securely access their accounts, making our application more secure and user-friendly.

### Next Steps

Explore enhancing authentication with additional strategies and implementing features such as password reset, email verification, and more secure session management.
