## Lesson 5: Integrating Ethereum Wallet Functionality

### Objective

Build upon the foundation laid in previous lessons by integrating Ethereum wallet functionality, enabling users to view their Ethereum balance in the application. This lesson highlights the process of fetching Ethereum balance data and reinforces the dynamic cryptocurrency handling introduced earlier.

### High-Level Steps

1. **Introduction to Ethereum and web3.js**: Overview of Ethereum blockchain specifics and the web3.js library for interacting with Ethereum nodes.
2. **Setup web3.js**: Installation and configuration of web3.js to connect to the Ethereum network. `npm install web3`
3. **Infura Setup and Sepolia Testnet**: Create an Infura account and generate an API key to connect to the Ethereum network, specifically using the Sepolia testnet for safe development and testing.
4. **Fetch Ethereum Balance**: Implement the functionality in `walletRoutes.ts` to fetch and display Ethereum balances, using web3.js and your Ethereum node service provider (e.g., Infura).
5. **Dynamic Cryptocurrency Support**: Leverage the flexible structure established in previous lessons to easily integrate Ethereum balance fetching alongside Bitcoin.
6. **Update Dashboard**: Ensure the dashboard dynamically displays Ethereum balance for users with an Ethereum address set up.

### Conclusion

This lesson extends the application's cryptocurrency tracking capabilities to Ethereum, utilizing web3.js for direct blockchain interaction and emphasizing scalable code structure for future cryptocurrency additions.

### Next Steps

Consider enhancing the application by adding real-time price tracking, integrating more cryptocurrencies, or implementing advanced features such as transaction history or token tracking.
