# Lesson 6b: Implementing Mocks and Writing Tests

## Objective

Further delve into testing by creating mocks for external dependencies like Passport, Axios, and Web3. This lesson focuses on writing comprehensive tests for controllers, configurations, utility functions, and ensuring all parts of our application are correctly tested. By the end of this lesson, you should have a solid understanding of unit testing in a Node.js environment and be able to ensure your application is reliable and stable through automated tests.

## High-Level Steps

1. **Creating Mocks**: Learn to isolate your tests from external dependencies by creating mocks for Passport, Axios, and Web3. This step ensures that your tests are not reliant on external services and APIs, leading to faster and more reliable test execution.

2. **Writing Controller Tests**: Implement tests for your controllers to ensure that your application routes behave as expected under various conditions.

3. **Testing Configuration and Utility Functions**: Dive into the specifics of setting up your testing environment to efficiently and reliably test your application's configuration files and utility functions. We'll guide you through establishing a proper testing environment with global configurations, streamlining the testing process for enhanced efficiency and reliability.

4. **Add Unit Tests**: Implement unit tests to ensure the correctness and reliability of the application's functionality. Test key components, including controllers, models, and utility functions.

5. **Integrate Continuous Testing with Wallaby.js**: Set up Wallaby.js for continuous testing to provide real-time feedback on code changes. Adjust the jest.config.js file to configure Jest for compatibility with Wallaby.js.

6. **Test the Application**: Thoroughly test the application to ensure that all routes and functionalities remain operational after the restructuring.

## Test Scenarios

- Ensure all routes respond correctly with the expected data or status codes.
- Verify authentication and authorization mechanisms for protected routes.
- Test database interactions to ensure proper data retrieval and storage.
- Validate error handling mechanisms for edge cases and invalid input.
- Test the integration of third-party services or external APIs.

## Testing Tools

- **Jest**: JavaScript testing framework for unit and integration testing.
- **Supertest**: Library for testing HTTP assertions with Express applications.
- **MongoDB Memory Server**: In-memory MongoDB server for testing database interactions.
- **Mocking Libraries**: Use mocking libraries like jest.mock or sinon for isolating dependencies during testing.
- **Test Coverage Tools**: Measure code coverage with tools like Istanbul to ensure comprehensive test coverage.
- **Wallaby.js (Optional)**: Continuous testing tool for real-time feedback on code changes.

## Running Tests

1. Install dependencies: `npm install --save-dev jest supertest @types/jest @types/supertest`
2. Run tests: `npm test`

### Continuous Testing with Wallaby.js (Optional):

Wallaby.js is a powerful continuous testing tool that provides real-time feedback on code changes, allowing developers to quickly identify and fix issues. If you choose to use Wallaby.js, follow these steps:

1. Install the Wallaby.js extension for your preferred IDE.
2. Configure Wallaby.js:
   - Custom Configuration (Optional): You can create a `wallaby.js` file at the root of your project and manually configure it to match your project's file structure and testing setup. This step is optional and recommended if you have specific configuration needs.
   - Automatic Configuration: Wallaby.js supports automatic configuration for many projects. Simply start Wallaby.js in your IDE, and when prompted to select a configuration, choose **Automatic Configuration**. This allows Wallaby.js to intelligently configure itself based on your project setup, simplifying the process.
3. Start Wallaby.js in your IDE to enable continuous testing.

## Conclusion

By implementing mocks and writing tests for every aspect of our application, we've ensured its reliability and stability. This approach not only helps in identifying and fixing issues early but also enhances the maintainability and scalability of the project.

## Next Steps

Proceed to Lesson 7 to explore caching with Redis and enhance the application's performance. This next lesson will introduce you to caching concepts and how to implement Redis caching within your application to improve response times and reduce database load.
