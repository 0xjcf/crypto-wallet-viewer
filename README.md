## Lesson 6B: Implementing Mocks and Writing Tests

### Objective

Create mocks for external dependencies and write comprehensive tests for controllers, configuration files, and utility functions to ensure code reliability and maintainability.

### High-Level Steps

1. **Creating Mocks**:
   - Mock `passport` for authentication testing.
   - Mock `axios` for external API calls.
   - Mock `web3` for blockchain interactions.
2. **Writing Controller Tests**:
   - Test each controller function for correct behavior, error handling, and edge cases.
3. **Testing passportConfig**:
   - Validate authentication strategy, user serialization, and deserialization.
4. **Testing Utility Functions**:
   - Write tests for utility functions such as `fetchWalletData`, ensuring correct functionality and error handling.

### Tools and Libraries

- **Jest**: For creating mocks and running tests.
- **Supertest**: For simulating HTTP requests.
- **jest.mock()**: For mocking modules and functions.
